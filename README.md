- Stack blocks to fill horizontal lines.  
- Full lines disappear and score points.  
- Game over if blocks reach the top.  

* CONTROLS:  
- A: Move Left  
- D: Move Right  
- W: Rotate Block  
- S: Soft Drop (faster fall)  
- Space: Hard Drop (instant fall)  

* TIPS:  
- Plan ahead using the next block preview.  
- Use 'Hold' to save a block (if enabled).  
- Avoid leaving narrow gaps.  
- Try to clear 4 lines at once (Tetris!).
